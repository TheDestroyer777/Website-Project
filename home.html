            to work on a project or experiment within one of six current themes during the school year. The highlight of the contest is the final day on May 15, 2025, on which

              <!--These projects are more than just the scientific, engineering or coding part: we have to present our ideas and our results, we have to work together as a team,â€¦ So not only do we train our engineering, coding and overall science skills, we also train our communication, outreach and planning skills. -->
